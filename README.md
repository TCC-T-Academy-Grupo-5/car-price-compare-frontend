# Auto Value

## Project Description

This project is an Angular application called **Auto Value**, designed to [describe the main functionality of the application]. Recently, I refactored the translation and the project structure to enhance organization and facilitate maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18**: The framework used to build the application.
- **Docker**: To streamline the development environment and run the application.
- **Json-server**: Utilized as a simulated REST API during development.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Angular Material**: For styling and responsive design.

## How to Run the App with Docker

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
