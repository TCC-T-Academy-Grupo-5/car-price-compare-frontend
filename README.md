# PRECIFICAR

This project is an Angular application called **precificar**, designed to help users compare car prices using data from various online sources, including the FIPE table. The platform allows users to find specific vehicles, set alerts for price drops, and visualize price trends over time.

- [Precificar API](https://github.com/TCC-T-Academy-Grupo-5/car-price-compare-frontend.git)

## Objective

The project aims to develop a web platform similar to BuscapÃ©, but focused on vehicles. Users can compare prices of used and new cars from different online stores by collecting current prices through web scraping and comparing them to the reference values from the FIPE table.

## Technologies Used

- **Container**: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/);
- **styles**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/);
- **Icons**: [Google Symbols & Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

## Features

1. Search and Comparison Interface: Users can search for vehicles by types, brand, model, year, and location, displaying a comparative list of car prices.
2. Custom Alerts: Users can set alerts for when a specific vehicle's price falls below a certain value.
