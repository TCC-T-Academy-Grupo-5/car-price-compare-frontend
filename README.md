# Auto Value

## Project Description

This project is an Angular application called **Auto Value**, designed to [describe the main functionality of the application]. Recently, I refactored the translation and the project structure to enhance organization and facilitate maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18**: The framework used to build the application.
- **Docker**: To streamline the development environment and run the application.
- **Json-server**: Utilized as a simulated REST API during development.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Angular Material**: For styling and responsive design.

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory where your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are located.
3. Execute the following command to build and run the application:

To start the application, use the following command:
